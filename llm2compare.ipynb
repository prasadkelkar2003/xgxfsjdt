The question is asking which planet is known as the Red Planet. The options are Earth, Mars, Jupiter, and Venus. Hmm, I remember from school that Mars is often called the Red Planet. But wait, why is that? Maybe because of its reddish appearance in the sky? I think that\\'s due to iron oxide, like rust, on its surface. Let me double-check. Earth is called the Blue Planet because of the water. Jupiter is a gas giant, mostly bands of color but not red. Venus is often referred to as the Morning Star or Evening Star but not red.
